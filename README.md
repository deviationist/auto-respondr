# Facebook auto-responder
Browser automation tool to auto-reply to facebook messages.

## Setup
1. Ensure that you have [installed the browser binaries](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#managing-browser-binaries).
2. Run `npm install`
3. Copy file `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values
4. Run `npm run dev` for automatic reload, or `npm run start`.
5. Park as you like!

If you want to run this in production I'd recommend using [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).
